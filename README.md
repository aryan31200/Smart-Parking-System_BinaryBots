# Book My Spot
*By BinaryBots*

**Topic**: *Smart Parking System implementation in Metropolitan Cities.*

**Overview**:

Unavailability of parking spots in metropolitan cities is a challenge which is often undermined. Finding a parking spot is annoying and can take upto 25-30 minutes in cities like Bangalore which in-turn can become a cause of tragedy unknowingly (emergency cases). To deal with this trouble we have come up with a smart parking solution which can save both time as well as fuel.
